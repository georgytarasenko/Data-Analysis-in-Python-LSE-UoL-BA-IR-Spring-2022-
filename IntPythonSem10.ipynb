    "What is probability? Let's assume the situation when we expect some important event to occur. For instance, you are waiting for your friend at assigned point. We can imagine that some embarrassments can result in your friend's delay. If we divide number of scenarios where some embarrassment emerges by number of all possible scenarios, we get value that is known as <i style=\"color: darkred;\">probability</i>. Thus, the probability is $p=\\frac{n}{N}$ where $n$ is number of outcomes when event occurs and $N$ is number of all possible outcomes.\n",
